        Early in her academic career, psychologist Wendy Wood noticed a trend: many of her fellow graduate students and
        professors struggled to get things done in the highly demanding but unstructured academic environment.
        Intelligence, talent, and motivation didn’t seem to matter—some of those who were struggling to stick to project
        plans or meet deadlines were among the brightest of the group. Why, she wondered, was it so easy to make the
        initial decision to change but so hard to persist in the long term? Willpower didn’t seem to be the issue—her
        colleagues wanted to and were trying to change—so what was? Over the past three decades, Wood has sought the
        answers to these questions. She recently wrote a book, Good Habits, Bad Habits: The Science of Making Positive
        Changes that Stick, which details the most important, practical insights from her research. We had the chance to
        talk about how better understanding how habits form and drive our behavior can help us change—and enjoy—our
        lives.

        Michaela Barnett: Habits are ubiquitous, and we all probably think we know what a habit is, but as a researcher
        who has studied habits for years, how do you define a habit? And why do you think it’s important that we
        understand them?


        Wendy Wood: You’re absolutely right that most people think they know what habits are.In fact, when I’ve
        conducted surveys, over 80 percent of people say they understand habits. But then I ask: So, how successful are
        you when you change behavior? Are you able to make changes and get them to stick? Those same people say, “Hmm,
        no, not very often.” So whatever people are understanding is not helping them.

        Habits are a learning mechanism. All we have to do is repeat something and get rewarded for it, and we’re
        learning a habit. In research that I’ve done, we find that about 43 percent of what people do every day is
        repeated in the same context, usually while they are thinking about something else. They’re automatically
        responding without really making decisions. And that’s what a habit is. A habit is a sort of a mental shortcut
        to repeat what we did in the past that worked for us and got us some reward.

        Most of us think of self-control as being able to force yourself to do things you don’t want to do. We have this
        idea that some people have super willpower and others don’t. You write a lot about why this is the wrong way to
        think about self-control. Why is that?

        Many people actually confuse habit and self-control. The majority of people in my surveys say that in order to
        start a new habit you have to exert self-control, and that’s just not true. The issue with self-control is that
        we all know people who are just more successful at almost every domain of their lives, and psychologists have
        developed scales to identify these people by measuring how much self-control they have.

        The people who score high on these scales tend to weigh less than the rest of us. They are more likely to have
        saved enough money for retirement. They have happier relationships, they’re more productive at work, they get
        better grades at school. These are all things that are associated with what we think of as self-control. But
        recent research by Angela Duckworth and colleagues has shown a fascinating contradiction: people who score high
        on self-control don’t achieve successes in life by exerting control. They are not practicing self-denial by
        white-knuckling through life. Instead, they know how to form habits that meet their goals.

        We find that about 43 percent of what people do every day is repeated in the same context, usually while they
        are thinking about something else.

        So, people who we thought had high self-control to achieve great life outcomes instead are really good at
        forming the right habits. They seem to understand the influence of situations and choose ones in which it’s
        easier to repeat desired actions. They don’t have much “friction” in their lives and so are not tempted to act
        in counterproductive ways.

        It feels like changing our perspective on self-control can really help us reclaim our sense of self-worth and be
        kinder to ourselves. We can tweak our environments rather than continuously berating ourselves for “Oh man, I
        did this thing again that I didn’t want to do.” It’s a liberating way to view it.

        That’s the flip side of self-control. It’s great to say: “Yes, I have a lot of self-control, and I am good at
        resisting temptation.” But so often we fail and then we feel like failures. It does sort of liberate us from
        that very unhappy kind of experience in a way.

        Can you tell me about the M&M and carrot study you did and what it tells us about how our thinking self can
        actually get in the way of some of our health goals?

        This was a study that I did with Pei-Ying Lin and John Monterosso. We trained people to choose carrots in a
        computer game. People played the game when they were hungry and they actually got the carrots. They had to move
        a joystick in the direction of the carrots when they saw them on the screen, and then they won carrots and got
        to eat them. All of our participants liked carrots, but they also liked chocolate. And after we had trained
        people to choose carrots by moving a joystick toward the carrots whenever they saw them on the screen, we gave
        them the opportunity to choose M&M’s if they wanted to. Now, when the screen was set up in just the same way as
        it was during training, people continued to choose carrots. Over 60 percent of them chose the carrots. But when
        the screen changed and they had to actually move the joystick in a different direction, then they stopped to
        think. And many more of them chose M&M’s.

        We have found that when people are distracted or feeling particularly tired or overwhelmed, they fall back on
        good habits as well as bad habits.
