        IT HAS NOW been over forty years since the first edition of <u>A Random Walk
            Down Wall Street</u>. The message of the original edition was a very simple one:
        Investors would be far better off buying and holding an index fund than
        attempting to buy and sell individual securities or actively managed mutual
        funds. I boldly stated that buying and holding all the stocks in a broad <b><i>stockmarket
                average</i></b> was likely to outperform professionally managed funds whose
        <b><i>high expense charges and large trading costs detract substantially from
                investment returns</i></b>. <br>
        Now, over forty years later, I believe even more strongly in that <b><i>original
                thesis</i></b>, and there’s more than a six-figure gain to prove it. I can make the case
        with great simplicity. An investor with $10,000 at the start of 1969 who invested
        in a Standard & Poor’s 500-Stock Index Fund would have had a portfolio worth
        $736,196 by June 2014, assuming that all dividends were reinvested. A second
        investor who instead purchased shares in the average actively managed fund
        would have seen his investment grow to $501,470. The difference is dramatic.<br>
        Through June 1, 2014, the index investor was ahead by $234,726, an amount
        almost 50 percent greater than the final stake of the average investor in a
        managed fund.<br>
        My wife, <u>Nancy Weiss Malkiel,</u> has made by far the most important
        contributions to the successful completion of the past seven editions. In addition
        to providing the most loving <b><i>encouragement and support</i></b>, she read carefully
        through various drafts of the manuscript and made innumerable suggestions that
        clarified and vastly improved the writing. She continues to be able to find errors
        that have eluded me and a variety of proofreaders and editors. Most important,
        she has brought incredible joy to my life. No one more deserved the dedication
        of a book than she and her <b><i>second-best friend, Piper</i></b>.
