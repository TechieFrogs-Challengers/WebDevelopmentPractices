    <h1>5 Habits Of Lucky People</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I believe in luck. I also believe in showing up, working hard, and being exceptional, of course. But there’s a small
        proportion of magic, accessed when all the inputs are right, that can only be attributed to chance. To coincidence or a
        fluke or destiny. Call it whatever you want. Believing in luck means you recognise that there is an element of your life
        and work over which you have no control. It’s empowering and freeing and feels like a game.
        Some people always seem to be on the right side of luck. They’re jammy, or favoured in some way. You might be able to
        picture them now. If you asked, they might point to good decision-making, or quote a phrase such as Samuel Goldwyn’s
        “the harder I work, the luckier I get”. But really, being lucky is a system that anyone can apply, to reap the rewards
        again and again.
